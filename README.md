## This repo contains source code for my project Webtimize.Me; an online SEO audit generator -- Project dated: June 2013

### Project details: http://talhaparacha.com/seo-project/

###Notes:

1) mainscript.php gets called to generate SEO audit for any website. It contains calls to functions for checking SEO factors.

2) All other get_*.php, is_*.php files check for some SEO factor and return results accordingly. Test cases for debugging purposes are present in these files for seeing whether each component is working as expected or not.

3) mainscript.php starts building the audit on top of a tempelate provided by Sample.pdf.

4) Some sample websites' SEO audits as generated by the tool are already present for anyone to see e.g. hitechanalogy.com.pdf etc.

5) Make slight modifications in mainscript.php for running this project in real time.
